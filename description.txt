- [i:Cog] Forces mods to have their code extracted
- [i:PaintingMartiaLisa] Forces mods to have their resources extracted

Some mods in tModLoader have the code and resources hidden when they are extracted, which can be annoying for modders wanting to add cross-mod support or people wanting to use mods as a learning resource.

This mod allows any mod to have its code and resources extracted. If you want to test this, you can try it on this mod, since it has been set to hide its code and resources when extracted. Another mod this can be tested on is Calamity, since it also hides it's resources and code when extracted. There is also a config for toggling whether code and resources should be extracted.

To extract a mod, download it and open it's mod info menu and click the extract button. After a mod is extracted, you can find its resources and the dll containing the code in the following folder: "C:\Users\{username}\Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader\ModReader\{modname}". The dll is also located in the following folder: "C:\Users\{username}\Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader\ModSources\ModAssemblies". The extracted mod doesn't actually contain the .cs files containing the source code, only the compiled dll, which can be opened in a program like dnSpy to view the C# code.

tModUnpacker (linked on the Steam Page) is a similar tool which works for 1.3 mods as well (thanks to AwesomeSavage777 for pointing this out), though it may be buggier, however I haven't tested it myself.
